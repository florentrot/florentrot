## Full Stack App - Built From Scratch

A complete full-stack application designed and developed from the ground up.

🔗 GitHub: [Full Stack App](https://github.com/florentrot/full-stack-app)  

### Backend Features (Spring Boot):
- RESTful CRUD API (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Global Exception Handling using `@ControllerAdvice`
- Swagger
- DTO + Entity + Repository
- Basic mapping logic (manual/simple mapper)
- MySQL integration using Spring Data JPA

### Frontend Features (Angular):
- Responsive UI built with Angular
- Consumes the APIs from the backend
- Routing and component-based architecture

---

This project helped me reinforce core concepts like:
- Spring Boot architecture (Beans, Services, Repositories)
- DTO <-> Entity mapping
- Connecting frontend with a secure backend API using JWT

---

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you'd like to discuss the architecture!
